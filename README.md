# RESPONSIVE DROPDOWN NAVIGATION BAR

This responsive dropdown navigation bar built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation bar is fully adaptive, ensuring an optimal user experience across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## Key Features:
Responsive Design: The navigation bar dynamically adjusts its layout based on the screen size. On larger screens, all menu items are displayed inline, while on smaller screens, they collapse into a hamburger menu that triggers a dropdown.

Smooth Transitions: The dropdown menu includes smooth animations for better user interaction when opening or closing the menu.

Dropdown Submenus: Supports nested dropdowns for multi-level navigation. These submenus also adapt to screen sizes, with touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices.

Cross-browser Compatibility: Works seamlessly across modern browsers, ensuring consistent behavior on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Accessibility: Includes features like keyboard navigation and proper aria attributes for improved accessibility.

This repository is ideal for anyone looking to implement a modern, responsive, and accessible navigation bar in their web projects.
